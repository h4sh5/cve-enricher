# CVE enricher

Enriches CVE-IDs to provide CVSS, EPSS, Github POCs and nuclei templates.

Heavily subject to rate limiting.

## Usage

given a file with CVEs like this:

```
CVE-2024-12345
CVE-2024-12346
CVE-2024-12347
```

it will pull data from various sources and render it on index.html, very similar to the format of [fedisecfeeds](https://fedisecfeeds.github.io). It's almost direct code reuse from that project.

```
python3 enricher.py ./cves
```
